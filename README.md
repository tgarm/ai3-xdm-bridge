XDM Bridge Web Interface for AI3
--------------------------------

XDM - Cross Domain

The official XDM transfer method described in Autonomys at (https://docs.autonomys.xyz/farming/guides/xdm/), is not quite user friendly, user need to use polkadot.js.org development interface, and fill address and transfer amount in a very long format manually.

To simplify the transfer operation, I created this web interface.

User may easily transfer from Consensus to Auto-EVM domain, and vice versa.

The transfer progress/history panel is working for Consensus to Auto-EVM transfer, not for Auto-EVM to Consensus yet.

Co-operation is welcome.
